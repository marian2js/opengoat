OpenGoat lets you run a hierarchical team of AI agents with persistent sessions, task delegation, provider bindings, and an optional web UI.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm i -g openclaw opengoat
openclaw onboard
opengoat onboard
opengoat start
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:19123` and message `ceo`.

## What OpenGoat Solves

- Build manager and individual agent hierarchies (`reportsTo` model)
- Route execution through provider-specific runtimes (OpenClaw, Codex, Cursor, Claude Code, and others)
- Persist multi-session continuity per agent
- Manage tasks with enforceable assignment/update permissions
- Expose an ACP server for IDE/editor integration

## Start Here

- [Docs Hubs](/start/hubs): task-oriented navigation for the full docs set
- [Quickstart](/start/quickstart): production path from install to first run
- [Installation](/start/installation): npm, Docker, and source installs
- [Organization Runtime](/core/organization-runtime): architecture and invariants
- [CLI Overview](/reference/cli-overview): command map and global flags

## Key Runtime Rules

- `ceo` is the immutable root manager.
- Default entry agent resolves from `OPENGOAT_DEFAULT_AGENT`, then `config.defaultAgent`, then `ceo`.
- Sessions are preserved per `agent + session key/id`.
- OpenGoat is the source of truth for organization structure.
- Agent execution behavior is skill-driven, not an internal planner loop.
