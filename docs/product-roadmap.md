# Initial Product Roadmap for OpenGoat

## Overview

OpenGoat is a platform for building and managing AI agent organizations that transform ambiguous goals into clear, trustworthy outcomes. This initial roadmap focuses on core functionalities to establish a minimum viable product (MVP) aligned with our vision of scalable, efficient AI delegation.

## User Personas

1. **Founders/CEOs**: Strategic users who define org structures and high-level goals. They need tools for setup and oversight.
2. **Team Leads**: Managers who assign tasks, monitor progress, and coordinate teams. They require visibility and control.
3. **Individual AI Agents**: Executors of tasks. They need memory, tools, and collaboration capabilities.
4. **Business Users**: End-users leveraging the AI org for outcomes, such as automation or decision support.
5. **Developers**: Technical users extending the platform with custom agents, integrations, and tools. They require SDKs, APIs, and documentation for customization.

## Key Features and Rationale

1. **Agent Hierarchy Management**
   - Description: Create, organize, and manage AI agents in reporting structures.
   - Rationale: Enables scalable delegation, a core principle in our vision. Without this, orgs can't grow beyond flat structures.
   - Priority: High (MVP)

2. **Task Assignment and Tracking**
   - Description: Create tasks, assign to agents, track status with blockers, artifacts, and worklogs.
   - Rationale: Makes work visible and accountable, reducing chaos and ensuring outcomes are delivered.
   - Priority: High (MVP)

3. **Persistent Memory System**
   - Description: Agents maintain long-term memory across sessions for continuity.
   - Rationale: Prevents repetition and improves efficiency, aligning with minimal waste.
   - Priority: Medium (Post-MVP)

4. **Tool and Skill Integration**
   - Description: Seamless access to external tools, skills, and APIs for agents.
   - Rationale: Empowers agents to perform real-world tasks, turning plans into actions.
   - Priority: High (MVP)

5. **Agent Collaboration Tools**
   - Description: Messaging, task handoff, and coordination between agents.
   - Rationale: Supports intentional coordination to unblock work without human intervention.
   - Priority: Medium (Post-MVP)

6. **OpenGoat SDK** (From DevRel Recommendation)
   - Description: Software development kit for creating and integrating custom AI agents.
   - Rationale: Allows developers to extend OpenGoat, promoting scalability and customization.
   - Priority: High (MVP)

7. **RESTful APIs for Management** (From DevRel Recommendation)
   - Description: APIs for programmatic task creation, agent assignment, and monitoring.
   - Rationale: Enables integration with external systems for automated workflows.
   - Priority: High (Post-MVP)

8. **Interactive Documentation and Tutorials** (From DevRel Recommendation)
   - Description: Comprehensive docs with code samples and quick-start guides.
   - Rationale: Reduces onboarding time for developers.
   - Priority: Medium (MVP)

9. **Plugin Architecture for Tools/Skills** (From DevRel Recommendation)
   - Description: Modular system for adding custom tools and skills.
   - Rationale: Fosters community contributions and customization.
   - Priority: Medium (Post-MVP)

10. **Performance Monitoring Dashboard** (From DevRel Recommendation)
    - Description: Dashboard for real-time metrics on agent performance and task efficiency.
    - Rationale: Provides insights for optimization, aligning with efficient outcomes.
    - Priority: Medium (Post-MVP)

## Priorities and Timeline

- **Q1 2026 (MVP Launch)**: Agent management, task tracking, basic tool integration, SDK, interactive docs.
- **Q2 2026**: Memory system, collaboration tools, APIs, plugin architecture, initial user feedback iterations.
- **Ongoing**: Align with market fit feedback from Growth Lead and monitor success signals like user adoption and outcome delivery efficiency.

This roadmap is initial and will evolve based on feedback and market needs. It directly supports our vision of trustworthy, scalable AI organizations. Integrated DevRel recommendations to enhance developer focus.
