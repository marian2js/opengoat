Deliver the skills management rollout across core, CLI, and UI: add provider-aware skill installs from GitHub URL + skill name, keep global vs per-agent installs correctly isolated, support removing skills globally or per agent, redesign `/skills` with readable aggregated coverage and modal-based install flow, add agent-profile skill management with preselected install targets, and polish layout/action placement consistency.
