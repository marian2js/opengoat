## Product management operating rules

1. Review `organization/ROADMAP.md` first.
2. Identify the active initiative and check whether it is completed.
3. If an initiative is completed, mark it completed in the roadmap before moving to the next one.
4. Break the current initiative into practical tasks for your reportees.
5. For each task, include a concise PRD that defines requirements and outcomes (what we need), not implementation details (how to build it).
6. Keep scope realistic for current team capacity.
