# STRATEGY.md - How this organization will win

_Vision is the destination._
_Strategy is the set of choices that gets us there._
_If everything is a priority, nothing is._

## Strategy Snapshot

In one paragraph, describe:

- what we are trying to achieve
- for whom
- by doing what differently than alternatives

**Snapshot:**
<WRITE 3-6 SENTENCES. KEEP IT CONCRETE.>

## Where We Play

Define the arena. Be specific.

- **Customers / users:** <WHO>
- **Problem space:** <WHAT PROBLEM>
- **Context:** <LOCAL-FIRST | SELF-HOSTED | INTERNAL TOOLING | CUSTOMER-FACING | ETC>
- **Out of scope:** <WHAT WE ARE NOT DOING>

1. **<ADVANTAGE 1>**

## Strategic Bets

Bets are choices with risk. If a bet fails, we change direction.

### Bet 1: <NAME>

### Bet 2: <NAME>

## What We Will Not Do

This is focus. This is power.

- We will not: <THING>
- We will not: <THING>
- We will not: <THING>

## What We Will Measure

Pick a small set. If you measure everything, you learn nothing.

5. <PRIORITY 5>
