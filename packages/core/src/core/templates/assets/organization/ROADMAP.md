# ROADMAP.md - What we will deliver, in what order, and why

_Vision is where we want to end up._
_Strategy is how we plan to win._
_Roadmap is what we ship next to make both real._

## How To Use This File

- Keep it outcome-first. List the change in user or business results, not just tasks.
- Keep it realistic. If everything is "Now", this roadmap is not useful.
- Keep owners explicit. Every initiative has one accountable owner.
- Keep it current. Archive finished work and re-rank when reality changes.

## Alignment Check

Before adding an initiative, confirm:

- Mission fit: <HOW THIS SUPPORTS `MISSION.md`>
- Strategy fit: <HOW THIS SUPPORTS `STRATEGY.md`>
- Vision fit: <HOW THIS MOVES TOWARD `VISION.md`>

If it does not support all three, it should not be on the roadmap.

## Planning Horizons

Use three horizons to separate commitments from intent.
These labels represent priority depth, not fixed calendar durations:

- **Short term:** committed work in progress or queued next
- **Medium term:** likely priorities after short-term commitments
- **Long term:** directional bets, capability building, and optional future moves

## Initiative Template

Use this format for every initiative in every horizon:

- Initiative: <SHORT NAME>
- Outcome: <MEASURABLE RESULT>
- Why now: <WHY THIS IS PRIORITY>
- Owner: <AGENT-ID OR ROLE>
- Target checkpoint: <MILESTONE OR DATE IF USEFUL>
- Dependencies: <NONE | LIST>
- Status: <NOT STARTED | IN PROGRESS | BLOCKED | DONE>
- Exit criteria: <WHAT MUST BE TRUE TO CALL IT DONE>

## Short-Term Goals

### Initiative 1: <NAME>

- Outcome: <...>
- Why now: <...>

## Risks and Sequence Notes

- Key risks: <TOP 1-3 RISKS THAT COULD BREAK TIMELINES>
- Sequence rules: <WHAT MUST HAPPEN BEFORE WHAT>
- De-scoping options: <WHAT WE DROP FIRST IF CAPACITY SHRINKS>

## Review Cadence

- Weekly: update status and blockers
- Biweekly: reorder short-term and medium-term priorities based on new evidence
- Monthly: confirm roadmap still matches mission, strategy, and vision
- After any major change: note what changed and why in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
