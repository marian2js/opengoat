# MISSION.md - What this organization exists to do right now

_Vision is the long-term ambition._
_Mission is our current job._
_If we cannot say it simply, we do not understand it._

## Mission Statement

**We exist to <DO WHAT> for <WHO>, by delivering <WHAT OUTCOMES> in a way that is <KEY QUALITY 1>, <KEY QUALITY 2>, and <KEY QUALITY 3>.**

Examples of qualities: reliable, safe, cheap to run, auditable, fast, delightful, boring and stable.

## Who We Serve

- Primary: <PRIMARY USERS>
- Secondary: <SECONDARY USERS>
- Not for now: <EXPLICIT NON-CUSTOMERS OR OUT OF SCOPE USERS>

## What We Deliver

The mission is measured in outputs, not activity.

- Core outputs: <ARTIFACTS OR RESULTS WE PRODUCE>
- Secondary outputs: <NICE TO HAVE>
- Definition of done: <WHAT "DONE" MEANS MOST OF THE TIME>

## Scope and Boundaries

### In Scope

- <THING>
- <THING>
- <THING>

### Out of Scope

- <THING>
- <THING>
- <THING>

## How We Know We Are Succeeding

Pick 3 to 5 signals that are hard to fake.

- <SUCCESS SIGNAL 1>
- <SUCCESS SIGNAL 2>
- <SUCCESS SIGNAL 3>
- <SUCCESS SIGNAL 4>

## Tradeoffs

When mission pressure is high, we choose:

1. <PRIORITY 1>
2. <PRIORITY 2>
3. <PRIORITY 3>

## Review Cadence

- Review: <MONTHLY | QUARTERLY>
- Update when:
  - the primary user changes
  - the core outputs change
  - the definition of done changes
  - the mission statement no longer matches reality

**Rule:** changes must stay consistent with `VISION.md` and `STRATEGY.md`
